# Recommendation-System-using-AI-HCI
This project implements a collaborative filtering-based recommendation system using the MovieLens 100k dataset. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

The recommendation system uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a matrix factorization technique, to predict user ratings for movies. The system is trained on the MovieLens 100k dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies.
